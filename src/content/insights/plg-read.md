# Plain Talk on PLG: Letting Your Product Sell Itself

Recently, while diving into PLG (Product-Led Growth), I’ve found that many people are still quite unfamiliar with this concept. As a seasoned veteran in the product world, I want to explain PLG in the most straightforward terms—it’s not some kind of mysticism, but a strategy that allows your product to “run on its own legs.”

## I. PLG vs PMF: A World of Difference in One Word

Many have heard of PMF (Product-Market Fit), which is like finding a romantic partner: your product needs to match up with market demand. For example, Slack saw that team communication was inefficient and created a tool to replace email—that’s PMF.

PLG, on the other hand, is more like “free love”: let users try it out first, and if they like it, they’ll recommend it to their company to pay for it. For instance, with Notion, when individual users enjoy it, they naturally spread the word to their teams. PMF is like saying “I’m a good fit for you,” while PLG is more like “You can’t live without me.”

## II. The Evolution of PLG: From Begging for Sales to Being in High Demand

Three eras of software procurement:

1. **The Era of Bigwigs Making Decisions (1980s-1990s)**
   Software was sold bundled with hardware, at exorbitant prices. Salespeople had to dine and play golf with CIOs; only with the right connections could they close deals.
   **Example**: Oracle, in its early days, relied on selling databases by winning over corporate IT leaders.

2. **The Era of Consultants Selling (2000s)**
   With the rise of SaaS, salespeople transformed into consultants, selling solutions with PowerPoint presentations. For example, Salesforce relied on consultants to paint rosy pictures for enterprises.

3. **The Era of Users Calling the Shots (Now)**
   Operations have become simpler, and users can try out products on their own. For example, with Feishu (Lark), when employees enjoy using it, they push their company to procure it.
   **Core of PLG**: Let users experience the value and proactively pay for it themselves or convince their company to buy.

## III. The Three Pillars of PLG: Making Your Product Self-Replicating

1. **Treat Users as “People,” Not “Data”**
   - Avoid vague promises like “increase efficiency”; solve specific problems. For example, Calendly directly helps users automatically schedule meetings.
   - Continuously optimize the product; every user complaint is an opportunity for improvement.

2. **Deliver Value First, Then Talk Money**
   - Free trials shouldn’t be “crippled versions”; let users truly enjoy the experience. For example, Canva’s free design features are sufficient for individual users.
   - Create “aha moments”: when users suddenly realize, “This thing is amazing!”
     - **On a Personal Level**: Submitting your first line of code on GitLab.
     - **On a Team Level**: Automatically syncing tasks on Trello.
     - **On a Company Level**: Calculating how much labor cost is saved with Jira.

3. **Drive Growth with Data**
   - Track user behavior, such as which steps have high drop-off rates.
   - Establish a growth team focused on viral activities. For example, Dropbox’s “invite friends to get more space” campaign.

## IV. Is Your Product Suited for PLG? The Soul-Searching Checklist

1. **Are Marginal Costs Low?**
   Adding one more user barely changes the cost. For example, with SaaS software, it’s just one more instance running on the server.

2. **Can Users Make Decisions on Their Own?**
   Individuals or small teams can decide to buy without layers of approval. For example, design tools like Figma.

3. **Can Value Be Quickly Validated?**
   Users can get started in 10 minutes and see results immediately. For example, Toggl Track records time and instantly generates reports.

4. **Is There a Network Effect?**
   The more people use it, the more valuable the product becomes. For example, Zoom—when everyone has it installed, video conferencing becomes seamless.

5. **Will Users Spread the Word?**
   The product itself acts as an advertisement. For example, with Notion’s template marketplace, users sharing templates attract more people to use it.

## V. Pitfalls of PLG: Don’t Follow the Trend Blindly

- **Don’t Expect an Overnight Transformation**: HubSpot took three years to fully transition to PLG, starting with small-scale experimentation.
- **Don’t Neglect the Sales Team**: PLG doesn’t mean eliminating sales; it means focusing the sales team on larger clients.
- **Be Honest with Data**: Don’t deceive users with fake data; genuine experience builds word-of-mouth.

## VI. The Future of PLG: A New Battlefield for Product Managers

PLG is reshaping the software industry. Previously, it was all about sales and channels; now, it’s about the product itself. As product people, we need to:
- Make the product experience exceptional, making users scream with delight.
- Use data to make decisions, not just rely on gut feelings.
- Design self-propagating mechanisms, such as referral rewards and community operations.

**A Final Honest Word**: PLG is not a panacea, but in this era where users are becoming increasingly “picky,” it’s a weapon that product managers must master. Instead of spending a fortune on advertising, let your product speak for itself—after all, user word-of-mouth is the most powerful form of advertising.

# 白话PLG：让产品自己卖自己  

最近在研究PLG（产品驱动增长）时，发现很多人对这个概念还比较陌生。作为一个在产品圈摸爬滚打的老鸟，我想用最直白的语言，把PLG讲清楚——它不是玄学，而是一种让产品自己“长腿跑”的策略。  

## 一、PLG vs PMF：一字之差，天壤之别  
很多人听过PMF（产品市场匹配），它就像找对象：你的产品得和市场需求对上眼。比如Slack，发现团队沟通效率低，于是做了个能替代邮件的工具，这就是PMF。  

而PLG更像“自由恋爱”：让用户先试用，觉得好再推荐给公司买单。比如Notion，个人用户用得爽了，自然会安利给团队。PMF是“我适合你”，PLG是“你离不开我”。  

## 二、PLG的前世今生：从“求人买”到“抢着用”  
软件采购的三个时代：  
1. **大佬拍板时代（80-90年代）**  
   软件和硬件打包卖，贵得离谱。销售得陪CIO吃饭、打球，关系到位才能签单。  
   **例子**：甲骨文早期靠卖数据库，全靠搞定企业IT负责人。  

2. **顾问推销时代（2000年代）**  
   SaaS兴起，销售转型成顾问，靠PPT卖方案。比如Salesforce，靠顾问给企业画饼。  

3. **用户说了算时代（现在）**  
   运维简单了，用户自己就能试用产品。比如飞书，员工用得爽了，倒逼公司采购。  
   **PLG核心**：让用户体验到价值，自己主动掏钱或说服公司买。  

## 三、PLG的三根支柱：让产品自己裂变  
1. **把用户当“人”，而不是“数据”**  
   - 别用“提高效率”这种空话，要解决具体问题。比如Calendly，直接帮用户自动安排会议。  
   - 持续优化产品，用户吐槽的每个点都是改进机会。  

2. **先给价值，再谈钱**  
   - 免费试用别搞“阉割版”，让用户真正爽到。比如Canva的免费设计功能，足够个人用户用。  
   - 制造“啊哈时刻”：用户用你的产品时，突然发现“这玩意儿真牛！”  
     - **个人层面**：用GitLab提交第一行代码。  
     - **团队层面**：用Trello自动同步任务。  
     - **公司层面**：用Jira算出省了多少人力成本。  

3. **用数据驱动增长**  
   - 跟踪用户行为，比如哪步操作流失率高。  
   - 建立增长团队，专门搞裂变活动。比如Dropbox的“邀请好友得空间”。  

## 四、你的产品适合PLG吗？灵魂拷问清单  
1. **边际成本低吗？**  
   多一个用户，成本几乎不变。比如SaaS软件，服务器多跑一个实例而已。  

2. **用户能自己决策吗？**  
   个人或小团队就能决定购买，不需要层层审批。比如设计工具Figma。  

3. **能快速验证价值吗？**  
   用户10分钟就能上手，并且看到效果。比如Toggl Track记录时间，立刻生成报告。  

4. **有网络效应吗？**  
   用的人越多，产品越好用。比如Zoom，大家都装了，视频会议就方便。  

5. **用户会主动安利吗？**  
   产品本身就是广告。比如Notion的模板市场，用户自己分享模板，吸引更多人用。  

## 五、PLG的坑：别盲目跟风  
- **别想着一夜转型**：HubSpot用了3年才全面转向PLG，先小范围试错。  
- **别忽略销售团队**：PLG不是完全不要销售，而是让销售聚焦大客户。  
- **数据要真实**：别用假数据忽悠用户，真实体验才能带来口碑。  

## 六、PLG的未来：产品经理的新战场  
PLG正在重塑软件行业。以前靠销售和渠道，现在靠产品本身。作为产品人，我们需要：  
- 把产品体验做到极致，让用户尖叫。  
- 用数据说话，而不是拍脑袋决策。  
- 设计“自传播”机制，比如邀请奖励、社区运营。  

**最后说句掏心窝子的话**：PLG不是万能药，但在这个用户越来越“挑剔”的时代，它是产品人必须掌握的武器。与其花大钱打广告，不如让产品自己开口说话——毕竟，用户的口碑，才是最硬的广告。
