# Requirement Customization and Product Refinement: A Product Manager's Real Thoughts

Recently, I've been constantly filling the gaps in product design. Over the years as a product lead, the most painful thing has been that the early-designed features were like "headless flies"—needing to satisfy the boss's ideas while also dealing with various practical implementation issues. Much of what we are doing now is essentially paying for past mistakes. This reminds me of some viewpoints from Wu Hao's *SaaS Entrepreneurship Roadmap*. Combining these with my own experience, I'd like to share some heartfelt thoughts.

## I. Three Hard-Learned Lessons in Product Refinement

### 1. Don't Let Engineering Mindset Ruin the Product

When I first started in the industry, I saw many startups fall into pitfalls during the research phase: Product managers would work in isolation to draw prototypes, and engineers would develop according to a "perfect logic." A few months later, when the product was launched, customers would say, "This is not what I wanted at all."

**The Truth**: B2B needs are rational and complex, and customers themselves may not be able to articulate their needs clearly. For example, when a customer says, "I want a faster horse," what they actually need is a "car."

**Suggestions**:
- Segment the market: First, figure out who the target customers are and what their core pain points are.
- Validate in a small scope: Select 3-4 top customers in the segmented market for in-depth research, involving the founder, product team, and sales together.
- Iterate quickly: Use an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to validate quickly and don't pursue "perfection."

### 2. Custom Development: The Sweet Poison

Early on, I was firmly against custom development, but reality slapped me in the face. A leading customer in a trillion-dollar market demanded a customized SFA product. Companies that insisted on productization were left behind, while the two that did customization captured the market.

**The Dilemma**:
- **The Project-Based Trap**: Earning "headcount money," with significant changes in requirements and a team that easily disbands.
- **The Productization Dilemma**: Large customers have strong personalized needs that are hard to standardize in the early stages.

**My Shift**:
- **Customization can be done in the short term, but with clear purposes**:
  - To make money: Take on large orders and deepen customer relationships.
  - To refine the product: Only do customizations related to the core direction to avoid being led by the customer.

### 3. The Life-or-Death Transition from Projects to Products

I've seen too many companies die during the transition:
- **Code Chaos**: Each project has its own version, leading to explosive maintenance costs.
- **Team Mindset Rigidity**: Teams accustomed to customization find it hard to switch to a productization mindset.

**Breakthrough Points**:
- **Control Customization Boundaries**: Only customize core functions and leave the rest to third parties.
- **Transition Early**: When revenue growth slows and team friction increases, productization must be initiated.

## II. Seven Consensuses of Domestic SaaS Companies

### 1. Don't Believe in the "Free Strategy"

Free makes customers think "this thing is not valuable" and lacks the motivation to use it. Keep the trial period to 1-2 weeks to create a sense of urgency.

### 2. Custom Large Orders: Accept or Not?

Before accepting, ask yourself:
- Does this requirement align with the product's long-term direction?
- Do we have enough resources to handle subsequent maintenance?
Otherwise, it's better to let go.

### 3. Where Should the SDR Team Be Placed?

SDR (Sales Development Representative) should be placed in the marketing department because their core task is to screen leads, which is more closely related to marketing collaboration.

### 4. Sales Can't Rely Solely on Marketing Leads

Companies that overly depend on marketing leads will eventually hit a growth bottleneck. It's essential to cultivate the sales team's ability to actively develop customers.

### 5. CSM Determines Renewal Rates

Renewals should not be handled by sales but by Customer Success Managers (CSM), who understand customer needs better and can drive long-term value.

### 6. Small and Micro Enterprises: The Graveyard of Tool-Type SaaS

Small and micro enterprises have weak payment capabilities and high churn rates. Unless they can be converted into high-value customers (such as through transaction commissions), it's better to be cautious.

### 7. Don't Take Multi-Year Orders, or You'll Suffer

Multi-year orders may seem to lock in customers, but they come with many hidden dangers:
- Poor service leads to bad customer experience.
- Product iteration becomes disconnected from market needs.

**Suggestions**: Gradually tighten the terms, reducing from 3-year orders to 18 months, and eventually return to the essence of a "renewal system."

## III. Words for Those Who Come After

Building a product is like feeling for stones in the dark to cross the river. The pitfalls I encountered early on can be summarized in seven words: **Don't be greedy, don't take chances, and don't be lazy**.
- **Don't be greedy**: Not all requirements need to be met; focus on core pain points.
- **Don't take chances**: Custom development may seem like a shortcut, but it could lead to a cliff.
- **Don't be lazy**: Visit more customers, ask more "whys," and make fewer decisions in the office based on intuition.

Finally, I'll share a real case: A SaaS company took on a large custom order to survive, only to fall into a "requirement black hole," forcing the founder to write code personally to put out the fire. This reminds us that **in the business world, there are no shortcuts, only perseverance**.

# 需求定制与产品打磨：一个产品经理的真实思考  

最近一直在填产品设计的坑。做产品负责人这几年，最痛苦的莫过于早期设计的功能像“无头苍蝇”——既要满足老板的想法，又要应对实际落地的各种问题。现在做的很多事，本质上都是在为过去的错误买单。这让我想起吴昊老师《SaaS创业路线图》里的一些观点，结合自己的经验，分享一些掏心窝子的思考。  

## 一、产品打磨的三个血的教训  
### 1. 别让工程师思维毁了产品  
刚入行时，见过不少初创公司在调研阶段就踩坑：产品经理闷头画原型，工程师按“完美逻辑”开发，几个月后产品上线，客户却说“这根本不是我想要的”。  
**真相**：B端需求理性且复杂，客户自己都未必能说清楚需求。比如客户说“想要更快的马车”，其实需要的是“汽车”。  
**建议**：  
- 细分市场：先搞清楚目标客户是谁，他们的核心痛点是什么。  
- 小范围验证：选3-4个细分市场的头部客户深度调研，创始人、产品、销售一起上。  
- 快速迭代：用MVP（最小可行性产品）快速验证，别追求“完美”。  

### 2. 定制开发：甜蜜的毒药  
早期我坚决反对定制开发，但现实给了我一巴掌。某万亿级市场的头部客户要求定制化SFA产品，坚持产品化的公司被甩在后面，而做定制的两家公司却抢占了市场。  
**矛盾点**：  
- **项目制的陷阱**：赚的是“人头钱”，需求变动大，团队容易散。  
- **产品化的困境**：大客户需求个性化强，初期难以标准化。  
**我的转变**：  
- **短期可以做定制，但要明确目的**：  
  - 为了赚钱：接大单，做深客户关系。  
  - 为了打磨产品：只做与核心方向相关的定制，避免被客户牵着走。  

### 3. 从项目到产品的生死转型  
见过太多公司死在转型路上：  
- **代码混乱**：每个项目都有独立版本，维护成本爆炸。  
- **团队思维固化**：做惯了定制的团队，很难切换到产品化思维。  
**破局点**：  
- **控制定制边界**：只做核心功能的定制，其他交给第三方。  
- **尽早转型**：当营收增速放缓、团队摩擦增加时，必须启动产品化。  

## 二、国内SaaS公司的七个共识  
### 1. 别迷信“免费策略”  
免费只会让客户觉得“这东西不值钱”，缺乏推动使用的动力。试用期控制在1-2周，制造紧迫感。  

### 2. 定制大单：接还是不接？  
接之前问自己：  
- 这个需求是否符合产品长期方向？  
- 是否有足够资源应对后续维护？  
否则，宁愿放弃。  

### 3. SDR团队该放哪儿？  
SDR（销售开发代表）应放在市场部，因为他们的核心任务是筛选线索，与市场协作更紧密。  

### 4. 销售不能只靠市场线索  
过度依赖市场线索的公司，迟早会遇到增长瓶颈。必须培养销售团队主动开拓客户的能力。  

### 5. CSM决定续费率  
续费不应由销售负责，而应交给客户成功经理（CSM），他们更懂客户需求，能推动长期价值。  

### 6. 小微企业：工具型SaaS的坟墓  
小微企业支付能力弱、流失率高，除非能转化为高价值客户（如交易抽佣），否则慎入。  

### 7. 别收多年单，会死得很惨  
多年单看似锁定客户，实则后患无穷：  
- 服务跟不上，客户体验差。  
- 产品迭代脱离市场需求。  
**建议**：逐步收紧，从3年单降到18个月，最终回归“续费制”本质。  

## 三、写给后来者的心里话  
做产品就像在黑暗中摸石头过河。早期踩过的坑，总结成七个字：**别贪心，别侥幸，别偷懒**。  
- **别贪心**：不是所有需求都要满足，聚焦核心痛点。  
- **别侥幸**：定制开发是捷径，但可能通向悬崖。  
- **别偷懒**：多跑客户，多问“为什么”，少在办公室拍脑袋。  

最后，分享一个真实案例：某SaaS公司为了生存接了定制大单，结果陷入“需求黑洞”，创始人不得不亲自写代码救火。这提醒我们：**在商业世界里，没有捷径，只有死磕**。
