# Product Restructuring: From Chaos to Ecosystem
As the product lead of FinClip, we embarked on a comprehensive product restructuring in 2022. This restructuring was not a mere functional upgrade but a systemic transformation from strategy to execution. Below are the core experiences I've summarized from the perspective of a product director.

## I. Why Restructure? — Identifying Hidden Systemic Risks
We found the system to be a tangled mess: The initial product design lacked coherence, and the turnover of R&D personnel led to a haphazard addition of features. The development team was still frantically adding new functionalities based on customer demands, delivering hundreds of new requirements each month, which caused the maintenance cost of the product to soar.

What's worse, the R&D cost was growing like a snowball. Investors believed that the product had already passed the 0-1 stage and should not continue to incur substantial costs for customer delivery.

## II. How to Restructure? — Breaking the Deadlock with Architectural Thinking
We took three key actions:
1. **Defining Clear Boundaries**: We consolidated dozens of fragmented functional modules into three core sections: "Container Engine," "Development Platform," and "Operations Center." For instance, we integrated the scattered permission management from four modules into a unified service, which increased development efficiency by 40% and reduced vulnerabilities by 62%.
2. **Layered Decoupling**: We redesigned the architecture like building with blocks, reorganized the system architecture and logic diagrams for the entire project, and began a complete redesign from the bottom-layer services and modules.
3. **Capability Extension**: At the beginning of the new version product design, we carefully considered the coupling and extension relationships between different modules. Any new functions that might be added later were logically connected and well-organized.

## III. Key Turning Points in Restructuring
- **Strategic Alignment**: The chairman and CEO of the organization attended the meeting and made the final decision, unifying the goals with the value of restructuring. In the end, the management team approved on the spot: "This restructuring puts us back on the right track."
- **Team Transformation**: Product managers had to learn to draw domain model diagrams. All the previously neglected underlying design challenges of the product had to be tackled one by one, with careful梳理 of state machines and flow logic.
- **Rhythm Alignment**: Product managers drove the progress of the restructuring project from start to finish. Even if some participants changed their opinions midway, as long as they didn't explicitly say no, there was still a possibility to continue.

## IV. Pitfalls and Future Directions
- **Cognitive Upgrade**: Product managers need to be able to translate customers' "improve security" demands into "sandbox isolation + dynamic permissions," which requires understanding both business and technology.
- **Technological Trends**: We tried using large models to analyze code, which increased the efficiency of service dependency analysis by 80%. In the future, we plan to use AI to predict requirements.

## Conclusion
Product restructuring is a tough battle. It not only addresses immediate technical debt but also paves the way for development over the next 10 years. Through this restructuring, we not only doubled the system's performance but, more importantly, established the mindset of "architecture as a service." Now, FinClip has become a technical middleware for corporate digital transformation, supporting various innovative scenarios from finance to government affairs. In the future, we will continue to break through with architectural thinking, enabling every enterprise to have its own digital infrastructure.

# 产品重构：从混乱到生态化
作为 FinClip 的产品负责人，我们在 2022 年启动了一次彻底的产品重构。这次重构不是简单的功能升级，而是一场从战略到执行的系统性变革。以下是我从产品总监视角总结的核心经验。

## 一、为什么要重构？—— 识别隐藏的系统性风险
我们发现系统像一团乱麻：最初版本的产品设计缺少条理，研发人员新老更替导致无数功能都是想哪里做哪里，开发团队仍在按照客户需求疯狂添加新功能，每个月累计交付上百个新需求，产品的维护成本一再变大。

更致命的是，研发成本像滚雪球一样增长，投资人认为产品已经过了 0-1 的阶段，不应该持续投入巨量的成本用于客户交付。

## 二、如何重构？—— 用架构思维破局
我们做了三件关键的事：
1. 画清边界：把数十个零散功能模块合并成「容器引擎」「开发平台」「运营中心」三大核心板块。比如把分散在 4 个模块的权限管理整合成统一服务，开发效率提升 40%，漏洞减少 62%。
2. 分层解耦：像搭积木一样重新设计架构，对整个项目重新梳理系统架构与逻辑图，并从底层服务与模块开始了一次完全的重构设计。
3. 能力延展：在新版本产品设计之初，就仔细考虑不同模块之间的耦合与延展关系，后续可能需要新增的功能都有逻辑联系负有条理。

## 三、重构的关键转折点
- 战略对齐：组织董事长与 CEO 参会拍板，用重构价值统一目标。最终获得管理层现场拍板："这次的重构让我们回到正确的道路上。"
- 团队转型：产品经理要会画领域模型图，以往没有人关注过的产品底层设计难题都要一个个重新啃下来，仔细梳理状态机与流转逻辑。
- 节奏对齐：产品经理从始至终都在推动重构项目进展，即使中途参与者意见转变，但只要没有明确说不，那就依然有继续的可能。
  
## 四、踩过的坑与未来方向
- 认知升级：产品经理要能把客户 "提高安全性" 的需求翻译成 "沙箱隔离 + 动态权限"，这需要同时懂业务和技术。
- 技术趋势：尝试用大模型分析代码，服务依赖分析效率提升 80%，未来计划用 AI 预测需求。

## 结语
产品重构是场硬仗，既要解决眼前的技术债务，更要为未来 10 年的发展铺路。通过这次重构，我们不仅让系统性能翻倍，更重要的是建立了 "架构即服务" 的思维 —— 现在 FinClip 已经成为企业数字化转型的技术中台，支撑着从金融到政务的各种创新场景。未来，我们会继续用架构思维破局，让每个企业都能拥有自己的数字化基础设施。
