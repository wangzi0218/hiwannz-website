# HIPA Cloud Project Summary: A Low-Code Platform Product Practice

## Project Background and Objectives
Amidst the wave of digital transformation, enterprises' demand for rapidly building management systems is growing. However, traditional software development is costly and time-consuming, failing to meet the flexible and ever-changing business needs of enterprises. HIPA Cloud (HIPA) emerged as a no-code application building platform, leveraging low-code technology and graphical interfaces to enable non-programmers to easily build software applications. Its goal is to reduce the R&D costs and usage barriers of management tools for enterprise customers and to quickly build management systems that meet business needs.

During the project's progression, I led the design of a technical solution based on intelligent data models and a visual process engine, innovating in line with industry best practices. This ultimately led to HIPA Cloud's acquisition by ByteDance and its upgrade to a core feature module of Feishu's multi-dimensional tables.

### Core Product Logic and Design
1. **Notification Center**: Using low-code technology, we quickly built the basic architecture of the notification center and implemented notification categorization, display, and reminder functions through visual components. We ensured the accuracy and timeliness of notification data by leveraging DBaaS for unified data storage and management. We also enhanced user experience by standardizing the notification sending process with BPMN workflows.
2. **Workflow**: We deeply integrated low-code, DBaaS, and BPMN technologies, introducing automation features that allowed business personnel to quickly define workflow segments through drag-and-drop and configuration, without the need for complex coding. We optimized workflows by using DBaaS for automatic data aggregation, validation, and analysis, combined with BPMN workflows to improve management efficiency and reduce human errors.
3. **Chart View**: We provided a rich set of data visualization options, enabling quick creation and customization of charts through the low-code platform's chart components. We ensured the real-time and accurate nature of chart data by obtaining and processing data via DBaaS data interfaces. We also optimized the display effects and interaction design of charts by standardizing the data acquisition and processing process with BPMN workflows.
4. **Website Redesign**: We quickly built the website's page structure using low-code platform templates and components, combined with DBaaS to achieve dynamic content updates. We enhanced brand image and user experience by optimizing user operation processes with BPMN workflows.

### Core Product Logic and International Standards
We strictly adhered to international standards to ensure the stability and reliability of the product. In low-code development, we referenced international standards and best practices to ensure the platform's ease of use, scalability, and security. For DBaaS, we followed database management standards to ensure that data storage, management, and access met industry requirements. For BPMN workflows, we strictly modeled and designed in accordance with BPMN 2.0 standards to ensure the standardization and understandability of workflows. We also innovated and optimized by combining HIPA Cloud's features with the design concepts of top-tier products.

### User Experience Optimization
We optimized the low-code platform's operation interface and interaction process through user communication, reducing the learning cost. We provided a rich set of templates and APIs to facilitate users' quick adoption and application expansion. We continuously collected user feedback to optimize product functions and interface design.

### Project Outcomes and Reflections
**Outcomes**: HIPA Cloud quickly accumulated a large number of users, with over a hundred paying enterprises. Users achieved business process automation and digitalization through the platform, significantly improving work efficiency. For example, XiaoTe Technology managed the entire order process through HIPA Cloud, nearly doubling its business management efficiency.
**Reflections**: The low-code platform's insufficient support for complex business logic requires further enhancement of functionality and performance. Additionally, for the product's continued provision of toB services to enterprises, there may be challenges in finding the right balance between order value and customization.

## Conclusion
The evolution of HIPA Cloud has profoundly taught me that the core value of a tech product lies in making technical capabilities instinctive for business personnel. By eliminating the boundary between data and applications with intelligent data models and replacing complex technical terminology with visual process engines, we ultimately achieved a digital experience where "what you think is what you get." This experience has also allowed me, as a "function designer," to gain a deeper understanding of the real needs and pain points of customers across various industries.

# 黑帕云项目总结：低代码平台的产品实践
## 项目背景与目标
在数字化转型的浪潮中，企业对快速搭建管理系统的诉求日益增长，但传统软件开发成本高、周期长，难以适应企业灵活多变的业务需求。黑帕云（HIPA）应运而生，作为一款无代码应用搭建平台，借助低代码技术，通过图形化界面，让非编程人员也能轻松搭建软件应用。其目标是降低企业客户管理工具的研发成本和使用门槛，快速搭建符合业务需求的管理系统。

在项目推进过程中，我主导设计了基于智能数据模型和可视化流程引擎的技术方案，结合行业最佳实践进行创新，最终推动黑帕云被字节跳动收购并升级为飞书多维表格的核心功能模块。

### 产品核心逻辑与设计
1. **通知中心**：利用低代码技术快速搭建通知中心基础架构，通过可视化组件实现通知的分类、展示和提醒功能。借助DBaaS统一存储和管理数据，确保通知数据的准确性和及时性。结合BPMN流程规范通知发送流程，提升用户体验。
2. **工作流**：深度融合低代码、DBaaS和BPMN技术，引入自动化功能，让业务人员通过拖拽和配置快速定义工作流环节，无需编写复杂代码。利用DBaaS自动汇总、验证和分析数据，结合BPMN流程优化工作流，提高管理效率，减少人工错误。
3. **图表视图**：提供丰富的数据可视化选项，借助低代码平台的图表组件快速创建和定制图表。通过DBaaS数据接口获取和处理数据，确保图表数据的实时性和准确性。运用BPMN流程规范数据获取和处理流程，优化图表展示效果和交互设计。
4. **网站重设计**：利用低代码平台模板和组件快速搭建网站页面结构，结合DBaaS实现网站内容动态更新。引入BPMN流程优化用户操作流程，提升品牌形象和用户体验。

### 产品核心逻辑与国内外标准规范
严格遵循国内外标准规范，确保产品稳定性和可靠性。在低代码开发方面，参考国际标准和最佳实践，确保平台易用性、可扩展性和安全性。在DBaaS方面，遵循数据库管理标准，确保数据存储、管理和访问符合行业要求。对于BPMN流程，严格按照BPMN 2.0规范进行建模和设计，确保工作流的规范性和可理解性。同时，参考一流产品设计思路，结合黑帕云特点进行创新和优化。
