# Yewen: Summary of YeWen Career Development Platform Project

## Project Background
In 2015, amidst the industry's winter when the knowledge payment market had yet to be awakened, I chose to join YeWen, an innovative company focusing on sharing internet career experiences, co-founded by former senior executives from Tencent. As an early member, I gave up a campus recruitment offer from Tencent to explore the "knowledge-sharing economy" model with senior experts from leading companies like Tencent. At that time, the industry widely questioned, "Would internet professionals pay for others' career experiences?" We spent two years trying to verify the possibility of this proposition.

## Core Operation Strategies and Practices
1. **Founding Team Resource Leverage - Expert Endorsement Matrix**: Members of the founding team, with their Tencent connections, invited top experts from BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) to join the platform through personal networks. We planned a series of content titled "Tencent People Teach You Product Management," which quickly increased the reading volume of our public account articles to over ten thousand by sharing methods related to the big company's career level system and product planning process.
2. **Cold Start Methodology Upgrade - WeChat Voice Penetration Traffic**: Users could directly book consultation appointments with top experts within the public account. By leveraging the strategy of forwarding in WeChat groups to obtain free call time, we achieved over 800 new registered users in a single day.
3. **Business Model Innovation - Offline Expert Dinner Plan**: We invited experts to invest their knowledge and share course revenue on a tiered basis. We also developed an offline expert dinner event where users could book face-to-face meetings with top experts.

## Key Achievements
- **User Growth**: Within three months, we published several viral articles, accumulating over ten thousand registered users on the public account, with a maximum payment conversion rate of nearly 10%.
- **Industry Influence**: Covered by multiple media outlets, YeWen became a knowledge-sharing platform with considerable influence.

## Personal Growth and Choices
- **The Underlying Logic of Giving Up Tencent's Campus Recruitment**: By a stroke of luck, I was moved by the founding team's vision of "experience sharing" – they had led several Tencent products with hundreds of millions in revenue but believed that "the real value lies in helping others grow."
- **Key Turning Point**: In the third quarter of 2015, when choosing between a Tencent offer and the entrepreneurial opportunity at YeWen, the founder shared his product philosophy: "You can always join a big company as a cog in the machine, but there are few opportunities to create a product that can change your own and others' destinies." This idea prompted me to join, as I firmly believed that the vocational education field holds greater social value than tool-based products.

## Conclusion
During my time at YeWen, I not only completed the transformation from "campus" to "workplace" but also profoundly understood that entrepreneurship is not about replicating the success of big companies but about validating value assumptions with the least cost under resource constraints. Although I missed the opportunity to join Tencent, I gained the invaluable experience of "going from 0 to 1."

# 业问：职业发展平台项目总结

## 项目背景
2015年，在知识付费市场尚未启蒙的行业寒冬中，我选择加入由前腾讯系高管联合创立的业问——一家聚焦互联网职业经验共享的创新型公司。作为早期成员，我放弃了腾讯校招offer，与来自腾讯等头部公司的资深专家共同探索“知识共享经济”模式。当时行业普遍质疑：“互联网人会为别人的职场经验付费吗？”我们用两年时间尝试验证这个命题的可能性。

## 核心运营策略与实践
1. **创始团队资源杠杆-专家背书矩阵**：创始人团队成员自带腾讯系资源，通过人脉邀请多位来自BAT的顶尖专家入驻平台。策划「鹅厂人教你做产品」系列内容，通过大厂职级体系、产品策划流程等方法论，快速增长公众号文章阅读量破万。
2. **冷启动方法论升级-微信语音渗透流量**：用户可在公众号内直接向头部专家发起预约咨询，利用微信群转发获得免费通话时间策略，单日新增注册用户800+。
3. **商业模式创新-线下大咖饭局计划**：邀请专家以知识入股，课程收益按阶梯式比例分成。开发线下大咖饭局玩法，用户可通过线下饭局预约头部专家线下面见机会。

## 关键成果
- 用户增长：3 个月内完成多篇爆款文章，公众号积累过万注册用户，付费转化最高接近 10%。
- 行业影响力：被多家媒体专题报道，成为有一定影响力的知识共享平台。

## 个人成长与选择
- 放弃腾讯校招的底层逻辑：由于机缘巧合，我被创始团队的「经验共享」愿景打动——他们曾主导腾讯多个亿级产品，却认为“真正的价值在于帮助他人成长”。
- 关键转折点：2015年Q3，在腾讯offer与业问创业机会间抉择时，创始人分享了他的产品价值观：“去大厂当螺丝钉什么时候都可以去，但做能够改变自己和他人命运产品的机会不多”，这个理念促使我选择加入，坚信职业教育领域存在比工具产品更大的社会价值。

## 结语  
在业问的日子里，我不仅完成了从「校园」到「职场」的蜕变，更深刻理解了创业不是复制大厂成功，而是在资源受限的情况下，用最小成本验证价值假设。虽然失去了加入腾讯的机会，却收获了比职级更珍贵的「从0到1」的完整经验。
