# Summary of Travel CMS System Construction and Operation Management Project

## Project Background
As one of the first domestic travel platforms focusing on "local guides leading the way," the company faced a core pain point in 2016: the operations team had to handle the entry of dozens of activity contents daily but was hindered by the development team's release update schedule. The product team, with limited resources, was unable to provide assistance, resulting in restricted operational efficiency and a disjointed user experience. I led the design of an internal travel content management system, aiming to restructure the content production process through technical tools, combined with data statistics and analysis needed for growth, to improve the entire process from traffic acquisition to transaction conversion.

## Project Background - How do we achieve the vision of "traveling like a local"?
As a travel company focusing on local tourism, we need to not only provide users with a good experience when browsing and placing orders but also offer reasonable assistance in managing travel product content and data support.

The diversity and fun of the tour routes, as well as the activities initiated by the operations team, are the only windows through which users can understand the product. The ability of the product manager to provide timely and adequate support to operational colleagues within the team is also one way to achieve this vision.

## Core Contributions
### Full-Chain Product Design and Implementation
- **Tool-Driven Process Restructuring**: Based on Tencent TAPD, an agile system was established to quickly respond to operational needs, promoting collaborative analysis of the operations team's pain points by UI/UX, development, and testing teams, increasing demand response speed by 40%.
- **Multi-End Experience Optimization**: Led the development of PC and mobile H5 ends based on the Vue framework, achieving 80% reuse of page structures through modular page design (such as activity titles, itinerary modules, content modules), solving the problem of rigid styles that are difficult to adjust quickly in traditional development models.
- **Operational Empowerment**: Standardized content entry into a unified JSON format and designed a "Content Sandbox" visual preview function, enabling operations personnel to independently configure and update content and pages, reducing dependence on technical resources and compressing the activity launch cycle from 7 days to 1 day.

### Data-Driven Operations System Construction
- **Manual Definition of Core Data Points**: Defined nearly a hundred core data points (such as "Special Page Banner Clicks" and "Dwell Time on Itinerary Detail Page") to establish a complete data funnel from traffic acquisition to content consumption and conversion payment. Utilized a mobile statistics system to create statistical funnels and dashboards, providing the capability to track activity conversions.
- **Strategy Optimization**: Identified patterns such as "click-through rate drops when the title exceeds 15 characters," leading to the launch of standardized title templates and an increase in content conversion rates.

## Key Achievements
- The system supported over a hundred activity updates and content entries per month, doubling the per capita productivity of the operations team.
- Promoted to Senior Operations Manager, laying the foundation for future dedicated product managers.

## Challenges and Reflections
### Technical Collaboration Pain Points
- The data tracking system did not reserve interfaces for A/B testing, missing opportunities to scientifically validate optimization strategies through experimentation.
- Product and development colleagues lacked understanding of the work modes and details in operational scenarios, resulting in lower efficiency during the initial exploration phase of the project.

### Cross-Role Management Experience
- When juggling both product and operations roles, occasional conflicts in demand prioritization occurred, which were later resolved by establishing a "Demand Value Assessment Matrix" model.

## Conclusion
This experience has profoundly taught me that even with limited technical resources, a combination of "tools + processes + data" can still achieve exponential growth in operational efficiency. It has also laid the foundation for my subsequent exploration of low-code development and the application of operational growth scenarios in product and operations fields, as I strive to become a "business-savvy product manager" and a "tech-savvy operations expert."

# Travel CMS 系统建设与运营管理项目总结

## 项目背景
作为国内首批聚焦「当地人带你玩」的旅行平台，公司在2016年面临核心痛点：运营团队日均需处理数十个活动内容录入，但受到研发团队发版更新的节奏困扰，产品团队资源有限无法提供帮助，导致运营团队效率受限，用户体验断层。我主导设计了内部旅游内容管理系统，目标是通过技术工具重构内容生产链路，结合增长过程所需的数据统计与分析需求，实现从流量获取到交易转化的全流程提效。

## 需求来源 - 如何实现“像当地人一样旅行”的愿景？
作为一家专注于本地游的旅行公司，我们不仅要为用户提供在浏览和下单时的良好体验，还要在旅游产品内容管理和数据支持方面提供合理的帮助。

旅游线路的多样性、趣味性以及运营团队发起的活动，是用户了解产品的唯一窗口。产品经理能否及时、充分地为运营同事提供支持，也是实现这一愿景的重要方式之一。

## 核心贡献
### 全链路产品设计与落地 
- **工具重构流程**：基于腾讯TAPD搭建快速响应运营需求的敏捷体系，推动UI/UX、研发、测试团队协同分析运营团队的需求痛点，使需求响应速度提升40%。  
- **多端体验优化**：主导基于Vue框架的PC端与移动端H5开发，通过模块化页面设计（如活动标题、行程模块、内容模块），实现80%页面结构复用，解决传统开发模式下样式固化后难以快速调整的问题。
- **运营赋能**：将需要录入的内容归档为统一格式的JSON，设计「内容沙盒」可视化预览功能，支持运营人员自主配置更新内容及页面，减少对技术资源的依赖，活动上线周期从7天压缩至1天。

### 数据驱动运营体系搭建
- **埋点体系设计**：手工定义近百个核心埋点（如「专题页banner点击」「行程详情页停留时长」），建立从流量触达、内容消费到转化支付的完整数据漏斗，使用移动统计系统建立统计漏斗与看板，提供活动转化跟踪能力。
- **策略优化**：发现「标题字数超15字时点击率下降」等规律，推动标题标准化模板上线，使内容转化率提升。

## 关键成果
- 系统支持每月活动更新与内容录入超百个，提升运营团队人均产能2倍。
- 升职为高级运营经理，为后续专职产品经理提供基础。

## 挑战与反思
### 技术协作痛点
- 数据埋点体系未预留A/B测试接口，错失通过科学实验验证优化策略的机会。
- 产研同事缺少对运营场景中工作模式与细节的了解，项目初期探索过程效率较低。

### 跨角色管理经验
- 身兼产品与运营双角色时，需求优先级判断偶发冲突，后续通过建立「需求价值评估矩阵」模型解决。

## 结语
这段经历让我深刻理解：在技术资源有限的情况下，通过「工具+流程+数据」的组合创新，同样能实现运营效率的指数级增长。这也为我后续探索低代码开发、运营增长场景在产品与运营领域的应用，致力于成为「懂业务的产品经理」与「懂技术的运营专家」。
