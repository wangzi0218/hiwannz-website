# Breaking Through Security Value in a Trustworthy Internet Environment

## Project Background
In 2018, amidst the rampant threat of online fraud, I took on the role of product manager for the industry's first "Trustworthy Website Certification" platform. With the rapid development of internet infrastructure and services, an increasing number of internet users were facing the risk of online fraud. Reports indicated that in China alone, losses caused by online fraud and misconduct amounted to a staggering 600 billion yuan annually. Faced with such a vast user base and a complex online environment, no single company could shoulder the responsibility of ensuring safe internet access for users. As a third-party platform, how could we contribute our efforts to jointly build a healthy and secure internet environment?

## Core Challenges
1. **Balancing User Safety and Experience**: How could we effectively reduce the risk of online fraud without compromising the free internet browsing experience of users?
2. **Cross-Industry Collaboration and Data Sharing**: How could we design a trustworthy data sharing and exchange platform across industries and platforms, connecting internet infrastructure service providers and online businesses, to achieve widespread dissemination of information verification and early warning messages?
3. **Business Model and Sustainable Development**: As a commercially responsible product, how could we design pricing and charging strategies to find a sustainable and profitable direction for development?

## Project Objectives
1. **Reduce the Risk of Online Fraud**: By collaborating across industries and sharing data, we aimed to decrease the likelihood of users encountering online fraud.
2. **Enhance User Trust**: We strived to establish a trustworthy internet environment where users could confidently utilize various online services.
3. **Achieve Commercial Sustainability**: We sought to design a rational business model to ensure the long-term profitability and sustainable development of the project.

## Key Achievements
1. **Efficiency Revolution**: The average processing time for work orders was reduced from 72 hours to 24 hours, and the customer complaint rate was brought down to single digits.
2. **Commercial Breakthrough**: Annual revenue exceeded tens of millions of yuan, with a stable renewal rate.
3. **Industry Impact**: We became the largest third-party cybersecurity public welfare organization in the country, handling over a thousand malicious website complaints each month.

# In-Depth Reflections on the Project
## 1. 0-1 Dilemma: The Lagging Nature of Security Value and Perceptual Misalignment
Users exhibited conflicting willingness to pay: when customers had not suffered any losses, they deemed certification as "optional," with a conversion rate in the single digits; however, when fraud incidents occurred, they would question, "Why wasn't it intercepted in advance?"

**Lessons and Attempts**: The majority of users find it difficult to perceive the "value of security" before a risk occurs. It is necessary to establish ways to change user perception.
- Threat Visualization: It is essential to implement a "real-time risk map" feature to dynamically display potential fraud attack trends and thereby increase user conversion rates.
- Trial Mechanism: A "time-limited security experience officer" program could be launched to guide enterprises to experience interception services for free and increase the conversion rate after expiration.
- Insurance Binding: Partnering with third-party insurers to offer "fraud loss insurance," where enterprises can receive up to hundreds of thousands of yuan in compensation for certification fees, can help increase renewal rates.

## 2. Misalignment and Reconstruction of Value Communication
Customers have stereotyped the product: Some public opinions believe that the value of the product is "paid labeling," ignoring the protective capabilities and technological value behind the product system.

**Lessons and Attempts**: Overemphasizing "certificates" while neglecting "process protection" during the early product promotion led to customer-perceived value falling short of expectations.
- Effect Quantification: Create multiple industry cases such as the "Fake Website Data Analysis Report" to illustrate with real examples how certification can intercept phishing attacks.

## 3. The Impact of Big Tech's Traffic Wars and the Choice of Ecological Position
User habits are facing intense transformation: Internet companies with significant traffic are trying to replace with their own products, and new mobile internet products in new scenarios such as short videos are beginning to weaken consumers' perception of "domain names."

**Lessons and Attempts**:
- Focus on the SME Platform Market: Develop "lightweight certification" products (such as certification card mini-programs) to further reduce customer signing costs and increase user growth.
- Cooperation with Emerging Platforms: Partner with emerging platforms such as Douyin and Kuaishou to provide new scenarios for "enterprise real-name certification," reuse the certification team's resources and capabilities, and explore new revenue points.

## Conclusion
This project has profoundly taught me:
- The "counterintuitive" design of security products: It is necessary to transform "invisible protection" into "perceivable value," such as real-time attack warnings and loss simulation calculations.
- The underlying logic of customer success: It is not enough to just deliver the product; we must also become the customer's "security advocate," using data to prove the value of protection.
- The survival rule under the shadow of big tech: In areas covered by giants, establish differentiated competitiveness through "scenario-based solutions."

In the trustworthy certification project, I gradually formed a product thinking framework of "starting with the end in mind," which allowed me to transform from a "function deliverer" to a "value architect." With limited resources, I always found the intersection of "customer ultimate pain points" and "commercial feasibility." In the future, I will continue to deepen this thinking and forcibly add a "terminal value reverse deduction" link in the requirement review to ensure that every decision directly points to the core value of the user.

# 创宇信用：可信互联网认证平台项目总结

## 项目背景
在网络欺诈肆虐的2018年，我成为了行业首个「可信网站认证」平台的产品经理。随着互联网基础设施和服务的快速发展，越来越多的互联网用户面临网络欺诈的风险。据报道，仅中国每年因网络欺诈和不当行为造成的损失就高达6000亿元。面对如此庞大的用户群体和复杂的网络环境，没有任何一家企业能够独自承担保障用户安全上网的重任。作为第三方平台，我们如何贡献自己的力量，共同构建一个健康、安全的互联网环境？

## 核心挑战
1. **用户安全与体验平衡**：如何在不牺牲用户自由上网体验的前提下，有效降低网络欺诈风险？
2. **跨行业合作与数据共享**：如何设计一个跨行业、跨平台的可信数据共享与交换平台，连接互联网基础设施服务提供商和网络企业，实现信息验证和预警信息的广泛传播？
3. **商业模式与可持续发展**：作为具有社会责任感的商业产品，如何设计定价和收费策略，找到可持续且盈利的发展方向？

## 项目目标
1. **降低网络欺诈风险**：通过跨行业合作和数据共享，减少用户遭遇网络欺诈的可能性。
2. **提升用户信任**：建立一个可信的互联网环境，让用户能够放心地使用各种网络服务。
3. **实现商业可持续性**：设计合理的商业模式，确保项目的长期盈利和可持续发展。

## 关键成果
1. **效率革命**：工单处理平均耗时从72小时降至24小时，客户投诉率降低至个位数。
2. **商业突破**：年营收突破千万元，续费率稳定。
3. **行业影响**：成为全国最大的第三方网络安全公益组织，每月受理超千条恶意网站投诉。

## 项目深度反思
### 1. 0-1 困境：安全价值的滞后性与感知错位
用户对付费意愿存在矛盾：客户在未遭受损失时认为认证「可有可无」，付费转化率仅个位数；但当发生诈骗事件后，客户会质疑「为什么没提前拦截」。

**教训与尝试**：大多数用户在风险发生前是难以感知「安全价值」的，需要建立一些方式改变用户感知。
- 威胁可视化：需要实现「实时风险地图」功能，帮助用户动态展示可能的诈骗攻击趋势，以便提升用户付费转化。
- 试用机制：可以推出「限时安全体验官」计划，引导企业免费体验拦截服务，以便提升到期后转化率。
- 保险绑定：与第三方保险合作推出「诈骗损失险」，企业支付认证费可获最高数十万元赔付，以便提升续费率。

### 2. 价值传递的错位与重构
客户对产品打上了刻板标签：有部分舆论认为产品的价值就是「付费贴标」，忽视了背后产品体系中的防护能力与技术价值。

**教训与尝试**：产品早期宣传过程中过度强调「证书」而忽略「过程防护」，导致客户感知价值低于预期。
- 效果量化：制作《假冒网站数据分析报告》等多份行业案例，用真实案例说明认证如何拦截钓鱼攻击。

### 3. 大厂流量战的冲击与生态位选择
用户使用习惯面临激烈转型：持有流量的头部互联网公司尝试自建产品取代，短视频等新场景移动互联网产品开始淡化消费者对「域名」的感知能力。

**教训与尝试**：
- 聚焦中小平台市场：开发「轻量级认证」产品（如认证名片小程序），进一步降低客户签约成本，提升用户增长。
- 新兴平台合作：与抖音、快手等新兴平台合作，提供「企业实名认证」新场景，复用认证团队资源与能力，开拓新营收点。

## 结语
这个项目让我深刻理解：
- 安全产品的「反直觉」设计：需将「看不见的防护」转化为「可感知的价值」，例如实时攻击预警、损失模拟计算。
- 客户成功的底层逻辑：不仅要交付产品，更要成为客户的「安全辩护人」，用数据证明防护价值。
- 大厂阴影下的生存法则：在巨头覆盖的领域，通过「场景化解决方案」建立差异化竞争力。

在可信认证项目中，我逐渐形成了「以终为始」的产品思维框架，这种思维让我从「功能交付者」转型为「价值架构师」，在资源有限的情况下，总能找到「客户终极痛点」与「商业可行性」的交汇点。未来将持续深化这一思维，在需求评审中强制加入「终局价值反推」环节，确保每个决策都直指用户核心价值。
